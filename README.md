BMP2Tile
========

It’s a program that can converts BMP, PNG, PCX and GIF format images into raw or compressed 8×8 pixel separated-bitplane tile data suitable for inclusion in SMS and GG homebrew programs. At the same time, it optimises duplicate tiles, creates a tilemap to recreate the original image and converts the palette for you.
