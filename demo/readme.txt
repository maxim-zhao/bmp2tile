BMP to SMS/GG tile converter demo
=================================

This is a demo showing how to use BMP2Tile data in an SMS program. The
.bmp files are the graphics; run the batch file to create the data 
needed. Compile the demo in WLA DX.

Works on a real SMS just as well as it does on an emulator.

Notice how the compressed picture is slower to appear than the 
uncompressed ones...
