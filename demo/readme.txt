BMP to SMS/GG tile converter demo
=================================

This is a demo showing how to use BMP2Tile data in an SMS program. The
image files are the graphics; run the batch file to create the data 
needed. Compile the demo in WLA DX.

Note that WLA DX sometimes doesn't work well with this, but at the time
of writing, it works OK.

It works on a real SMS just as well as it does on an emulator.

Notice how the compressed picture is slower to appear than the 
uncompressed ones...
